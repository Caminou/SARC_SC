# Single-cell RNAseq Analysis on Sarcoma


Full dataset is divided into Tumor + PDSC and Raw data from Tumor samples from Gruel et al

1) Data preparation and Quality control
  1. [Demultiplexing] 
  2. [QC](https://github.com/Caminou/SRC_SC/tree/main/QC)
  3. [Ambient RNA removal](https://github.com/Caminou/SARC_SC/blob/main/Ambient_RNA/)
  4. [Doublet removal]
2) Data Integration
3) Cell annotation
4) PDSC mapping and label transfer
5) CNV for Tumor-cell identification
6) DGE (Tumor vs PDSC) :tada:
